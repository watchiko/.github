# Watchiko

**Watchiko** is a real-time activity monitoring and reporting system designed for personally-owned computer systems. It helps users gain insight into their own system usage patterns, device events, and local activity ‚Äî all while respecting privacy and ethical boundaries.

## üéØ Purpose

Watchiko is built for **personal digital forensics** with a **live-first mindset**. It doesn‚Äôt just log what happened ‚Äî it alerts you **as soon as something happens**.

Whether it‚Äôs a USB device being plugged in, a suspicious process starting, or a file being transferred, Watchiko is designed to:

- **Detect** events immediately
- **Classify** them based on severity
- **Report** them to you or your cloud dashboard
- **Store** them for later analysis

It‚Äôs like a personal black box for your system ‚Äî but one that speaks up the moment something matters.

## üß© System Overview

Watchiko is built as a modular four-tier system:

- **Daemon**: A background service that monitors system-level events
- **Repository**: Local storage for event logs and activity data
- **Client**: A user-facing interface or API for viewing and interacting with logs
- **Communication Channels**: Mechanisms for syncing data and reporting activity to cloud services

## üß† Philosophy

Watchiko is built with a strong emphasis on:

- **Transparency**: Users know exactly what is being tracked
- **Modularity**: Event tracking is defined through composable event hooks and optional native implementations
- **Security**: Core features like cloud sync and reporting are non-optional and tightly controlled
- **Privacy**: No invasive features, no hidden surveillance
- **Forensic Value**: Every event is timestamped, classified, and stored for later review
- **Live-ness**: Alerts are generated **as soon as** events are detected ‚Äî not hours later

## üìÇ Event Hook Architecture

An Event Hook is a custom module used to detect specific type of event and provide to Daemon.
- Each **event hook module** consists of:
  - `./<hookName>/src/main.rs`: Logic of the hook written in Rust
  - `./<hookName>/Cargo.toml`: Dependencies required by the hook
- These modules are stored in the `hooks/internal` folder
- The final compiled hook will be generated in `./dist/internal` folder as `<hookName>/<hookName>.exe` (in case of Windows binary)
- Users can author their own hooks using the provided template and placed in the `hooks/custom` folder
