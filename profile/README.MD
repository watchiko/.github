# Watchiko

**Watchiko** is a real-time activity monitoring and reporting system designed for personally-owned computer systems. It helps users gain insight into their own system usage patterns, device events, and local activity ‚Äî all while respecting privacy and ethical boundaries.

## üéØ Purpose

Watchiko is built for **personal digital forensics** with a **live-first mindset**. It doesn‚Äôt just log what happened ‚Äî it alerts you **as soon as something happens**.

Whether it‚Äôs a USB device being plugged in, a suspicious process starting, or a file being transferred, Watchiko is designed to:

- **Detect** events immediately
- **Classify** them based on severity
- **Report** them to you or your cloud dashboard
- **Store** them for later analysis

It‚Äôs like a personal black box for your system ‚Äî but one that speaks up the moment something matters.

## üß© System Overview

Watchiko is built as a modular four-tier system:

- **Daemon**: A background service that monitors system-level events
- **Repository**: Local storage for event logs and activity data
- **Client**: A user-facing interface or API for viewing and interacting with logs
- **Communication Channels**: Mechanisms for syncing data and reporting activity to cloud services

## üß† Philosophy

Watchiko is built with a strong emphasis on:

- **Transparency**: Users know exactly what is being tracked
- **Modularity**: Event tracking is defined through composable event hooks and optional native implementations
- **Security**: Core features like cloud sync and reporting are non-optional and tightly controlled
- **Privacy**: No invasive features, no hidden surveillance
- **Forensic Value**: Every event is timestamped, classified, and stored for later review
- **Live-ness**: Alerts are generated **as soon as** events are detected ‚Äî not hours later

## üìÇ Event Hook Architecture

Watchiko supports a hybrid event hook system:

- Each **event hook module** consists of:
  - `hook.ts`: High-level orchestration logic that defines what to track and how to respond
  - `hook.go`: Optional native implementation for system-level access (e.g., USB detection)
- These modules are stored in the `event-hooks/` folder
- Users can author their own hooks using the provided template
- Hooks are dynamically loaded and can be enabled/disabled independently

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

To begin using Watchiko:

1. Install the software on your personal machine
2. Enable the event hooks for the activities you want to track (e.g., USB activity)
3. View logs and reports via the client interface
4. Sync data securely to your cloud dashboard (optional)
